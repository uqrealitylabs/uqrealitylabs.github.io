# How to Clone

1. Make sure that node (latest version) and npm is installed
2. Clone this project into a repository
3. Run `npm install` to install all the packages in `packages.json`
5. To load a live version of the app, run `npm start run`
6. To only build, run `run start build`

# Firebase CLI

1. Run `npm install -g firebase-tools` to install the CLI globally
2. Login using `firebase login` with your own google account - @benjamin.tran will add you
3. Run `firebase projects:list` to verify you have access to `uqrl-website` 

## Testing & Deploying Locally

To test ("deploy") locally, run
```firebase emulators:start```

Follow the terminal commands or go to `localhost:4000` for more info.
